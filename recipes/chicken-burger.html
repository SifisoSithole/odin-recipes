    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spicy Chicken Burgers with Mango Salsa is a delicious and flavorful dish that combines juicy, seasoned chicken <br>
        patties with a zesty mango salsa. The chicken patties are typically seasoned with a blend of spices, such as chili powder, <br>
        cumin, and paprika, giving them a spicy kick. These patties are then grilled or cooked until they're perfectly juicy and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
        The star of this dish is the mango salsa, which adds a burst of freshness and sweetness. It's made by combining ripe mango chunks with <br>
        ingredients like red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and sometimes a touch of jalape√±o for a hint of heat. This salsa provides a vibrant contrast <br>
        to the spicy chicken, creating a harmonious balance of flavors.
    </p>
    <p>
        When assembled in a bun, the spicy chicken patty is topped with a generous serving of mango salsa, creating a mouthwatering combination of spicy, <br>
        savory, and sweet tastes. It's a perfect choice for those who enjoy a bit of heat and a tropical twist in their burgers.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>

        <li>1/3 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            
        <li>1/3 cup chopped red onion</li>
            
        <li>1 large egg</li>
            
        <li>1 lime, zested and juiced</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
            
        <li>cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
        <li>5 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced</li>
            
        <li>1 mango - peeled, seeded, and chopped</li>
            
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            
        <li>4 slices gouda cheese</li>
            
        <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            
        <li>cup shredded lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground chicken, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, egg, lime zest, cilantro, garlic, and chipotle in a bowl. Shape mixture into four 1/4-pound patties.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir together chopped mangoes and the juice of the lime in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken burgers on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink inside, juices run clear, and burgers show browned grill marks, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>About 2 minutes before burgers are done, place hamburger buns onto the grill to toast, about 1 minute per side. About 1 minute before the burgers are done, top each burger with a slice of Gouda cheese, and let melt.</li>
        <li>Spread each bun with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise and top with 1/4 cup shredded lettuce and grilled chicken burger. Spoon 1/4 of mango-lime mixture on each burger and top with the other half of the bun to serve.</li>
    </ol>
