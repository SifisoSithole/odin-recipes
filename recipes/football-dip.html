    <h1>Best Football Dip Ever</h1>
    <img src="../images/football-dip.jpg" alt="football dip picture">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This dip is made for 3 to 6 men, sitting together on a Sunday, enjoying football and <br>
        eating every manly thing possible. Of course, my girlfriend and her friends love it too -- <br>
        but this stuff doesn't last long. Serve with your favorite tortilla chips and enjoy!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) jar prepared salsa</li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off grease.</li>
